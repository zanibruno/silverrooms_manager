This app is made for an Estate Agency that needs to manage properties, tenants and landlords .. 

Start by creating the landlord, then adds property to their portfolio. Then you will be able to add tenants to that property and rate then acordingly. 

As this is made for companies, the user is admin, you can create different user but all of them have access to everything and can delete and update tenancies created by others!
